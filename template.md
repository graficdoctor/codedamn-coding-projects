## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sort of a mobile-first workflow where I tackle the tougher parts first

I started this project a few times and I finished this built on the first code I've written about 6 months ago. Of course, I've been aquainted with lots more knowledge since. But instead of starting all over, I decided to dive into the old code, the old structure I used then and update it to my today's knowledge.

### Continued development

- Hamburger Menu
- Responsive Navigation
- Working with svg's (changing color on hover)
- Accessibility
